Worked on dynamic report generation using JasperReports and populated them with data from
 
PostGRESQL database 
VR MINI PROJECT IN UNITY 
Created a virtual world with a house, car, plane, hot air balloon. User can teleport from one 
object to the other and scene view changes based on user position by clicking a button on the 
controller. Scripts are used to animate the objects, simulate day and night cycle, turn the lights 
on/off based on the time of the day.

effort and honest planning. Because without 
integrity, our work is meaningless

RECENT
PROJECTS

■ Distributed mobile systems for energy-efficient collaborative augmented reality A set of mobile devices
that are wirelessly connected distribute and reconcile tasks essential for augmented reality so that a
consistent view is shared among them in a real-time, energy-efficient manner.

■ Throughput maximization of a hybrid WiFi-PLC enterprise network Given a set of PLC extenders
laptops, phones) at

plugged in at different power outlets in an enterprise and endpoint clients (e.g.
different nearby spots, we find optimal extender-client associations that maximize overall throughput.

■ Energy-efficient object detection and tracking on mobile platforms We design and implement an
intelligent object tracking on mobile systems that can significantly reduce energy consumption caused
by Deep Neural Networks while maintaining vision accuracy desirable to the users.

■ A measurement study of WiFi throughput enhancement with PLC extenders PLC-based WiFi extenders
claim to expand the network coverage and boost the end-to-end throughput for the users and this study
uncovers factors that impact this hybrid network performance through a measurement study.
